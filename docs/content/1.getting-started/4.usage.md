## Test Your Setup

Start your Nuxt development server:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

```bash [bun]
bun run dev
```

::

## Use in Client-Side Code

In your client-side code, you can now render the template by calling the render API endpoint provided by the module:

```ts
const response = await $fetch("/api/emails/render", {
  method: "POST",
  body: {
    name: "WelcomeEmail",
    props: {
      userName: "John Doe",
      confirmationUrl: "https://example.com/confirm?token=abc123",
    },
  },
});
```

::note
If you have the Nuxt DevTools enabled, you can also test rendering directly from the DevTools panel. You should see your `WelcomeEmail` template listed.
::

## Use in your Server-Side Code

You can use the `renderEmailComponent` function in your server-side code to render email templates. Here's an example of how to use it in a server route:

```ts
import { renderEmailComponent } from '#imports'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const body = await readBody(event);

  const html = await renderEmailComponent(body.name, body.props, { pretty: true });
  
  // You can now use the rendered HTML (e.g., send it via email)
});
```
